# BambuWars
In a galaxy far far away, a bambu frontend engineer test took place...

Setup steps:
1. npm i

Run steps PRODUCTION:
1. npm run start-build
2. Open html (need a client server, expressJS?)

Run steps DEVELOPMENT:
1. npm run start-dev

Tools used:
1. Webpack version 4
2. React Router Redux
3. React Redux
4. React
5. Bootstrap 3.3.7
6. Babel (utilizing ES6 so we need a transpiler)

BambuWars utilizes the Container-Component pattern.
This allows for cleaner separation of view from data management.
